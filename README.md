## Bloom

[Bloom](https://www.bloomclimate.com) was a SaaS that allowed companies to become climate leaders, from calculating their climate impact to communicating about their climate efforts. It connected to as many data sources as possible to assess your carbon footprint and find mitigation opportunities.

## Tomorrow is hiring!

Tomorrow, the organisation behind Bloom builds tech to empower organisations and individuals to understand and reduce their carbon footprint.

We're often hiring great people to join our team in Copenhagen. Head over to [our jobs page](https://www.tmrow.com/jobs) if you want to help out!
